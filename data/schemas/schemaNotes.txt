Changes to the format of mesmer data files so schemas can be used

* Attribute names are better unqualified.
Using this style fits better with CML and common XML practice.
So 
  <me:PTpair units="PPCC" P="30.0e16" T="720.">
rather than
  <me:PTpair me:units="PPCC" me:P="30.0e16" me:T="720.">

However, it has been necessary to introduce a qualified attribute name
to handle plugins with data (see below), as in
  xsi:type="me:HinderedRotorQM1D"

The attribute name me:type is replaced by role (which already appears in CML)
So
  <molecule ref="O2" me:type="excessReactant" />
becomes
  <molecule ref="O2" role="excessReactant" />

* <title> <description> <ref> used in Mesmer are not CML elements
(just CML attributes) and so
  <me:title> <me:description> and <me:ref> should be used instead.

Because it is not possible to add validatable extra structure to CML elements
it has be necessary to use <me:molecule> rather than <molecule> in 
  <me:InitialPopulation>
    <me:molecule ref="cyclopropene" population="1.0" />
  </me:InitialPopulation>

* The <mesmer> element should have an extra attribute xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
This is used as an extensible way of validating the elements of
those plugins which have their own data.

* Plugins with data should have the data as sub-elements of the plugin type. So
  <me:MCRCMethod>MesmerILT</me:MCRCMethod>
  <me:preExponential lower="0.9e-11" upper="9e-11" stepsize="1e-12">6.78e-11</me:preExponential>
  <me:activationEnergy>0.0001</me:activationEnergy>
becomes
  <me:MCRCMethod name="MesmerILT" xsi:type="MesmerILT"> 
    <me:preExponential lower="0.9e-11" upper="9e-11" stepsize="1e-12">6.78e-11</me:preExponential>
    <me:activationEnergy>0.0001</me:activationEnergy>
  </me:MCRCMethod>

  Plugins without data can continue to use the old format:
    <me:MCRCMethod>SimpleRRKM</me:MCRCMethod>
  but writing a schema that validates this has not proved possible.
  So use the new form even without data:
    <me:MCRCMethod name="SimpleRRKM"/>
  Mesmer can still parse the old form, with or without data.

* The CML schema CMLschema3.xsd has been modified in a few places,
making it slightly less restrictive. Search for "MESMER" in CMLforMESMER.xsd.

* The molecule names in MESMER (attribute id in <molecule> and ref elswhere)
do not always conform to the requirement in CML which is that they should start
with a letter or an underscore, contain only ASCII letter and numbers plus '-'
and '_' i.e. with no other punctuation or whitespace. In addition they can have
a prefix (like opt1:TS2). This has been relaxed for Mesmer but it would be good
practice to make new names conform.

* Use lower camel case for new element and attribute names (except for obvious
abreviations like the attributes P and T). This helps to make the capitalisation
more predictable. So me:initialPopulation would have been better than
me:InitialPopulation, but me:MCRCMethod is ok. 



H=H2,T+T2.xml
Should me:IRCPotential be more obviously a plugin?
